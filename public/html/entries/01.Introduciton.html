                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Tell me, do you want to learn how to create projects that can make the use of the web?</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p> On this website we will try to learn the basics of Spring Framework by creating a small
                            project
                            step by step. I will guide you through all the steps required to create the project from
                            launching your IDE up to the last lines of code.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p> Together we will write a very simple news portal. The platform will allow verified users
                            to view all news we have to display on our website and to add their own.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p> This little tutorial is targeted at people who got basic knowledge of Java and fundamental
                            programming skills. If you don’t feel that you are quite
                            familiar with what those are, I strongly encourage you to learn some Java before
                            attempting this course.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p> I also have to say that if you are already an experienced Spring developer this course
                            will <b>not</b> be useful to you either. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p> The idea is of Some Spring Stuff is to give you basic knowledge of something more complex
                            than simple for-loops and if-statements. The hope is that you would gain enough of
                            fundamental skills in order to create simple real-life projects starting from scratch.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p> After following through the whole course you will have a decent understanding of

                        <p>I know that starting to learn a new technology can be very hard. </p>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p> I remember when I started learning Spring I had many questions. It was not an easy job
                            to understand what is going on, and I think that there are two reasons for that:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>1. It does not make any sense what people say.</p>
                        <p> When I was listening to other programmers explaining to me how something works I
                            couldn’t understand what was going on. It was due to my lack of understanding of what
                            some technologies are capable of. But when that understanding had been developed, the
                            words those programmers were saying magically began making a lot of sense.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p> One of the goals of this course is to give you this entry point into Spring development.
                            I want to explain to you the fundamentals in the words that would make sense. Because
                            when you will be familiar with them you will be able to start looking deeper into more
                            complex topics with an ease.</p>

                        <p> Like every science has a lot of blocks it is made of, programming is an environment that
                            makes use of a lot of ideas and technologies. And for me it is not usually a problem of
                            identifying which technologies I would want to use in my project, but instead what
                            technologies there are? What else can I do with the technologies I already know? What
                            other major ideas I need to be aware of to become a better programmer?</p>

                            plenty of information about technologies that you need to know to be able to complete

                            understand what you are programming a bit better I advise you to read through them as well.

                            be able to understand what is going on in the course. I tried to keep it as short as

                            Firstly, I am not a professional Spring programmer. I learned this framework in 2020 and
                            since then I have been creating my own small projects. I most certainly won’t be able to
                            get into all the depth of every single question there is about Spring and back-end
                            development. However, I have an advantage. As I was also going through this path of learning
                            Spring, I know what are the topics that are convoluted and hard to get your head around.
                            This, I hope, should prevent you from spending days trying to understand how something works
                            and why. I will not use any complex terminology, and will describe everything as clear as I
                            can.

                            Second of all, I have to admit that I have never attempted creating such tutorials
                            before. I strongly encourage you to contact me via email, or use any contact from the footer
                            of any page. I will try to update the

                                Let’s start talking about what a framework is. A framework is a collection of
                                written code that lets you make use of functionality without worrying how it is
                                written. It is almost the same as using libraries that you didn’t write yourself.
                                But there is a difference!
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>
                                When you use a library you usually call some functions that you need to be carried
                                in your own code. You make use of prewritten functions in your own code.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>
                                Framework on the other hand has so much of the prewritten code that the way you code
                                will change. Framework will have realized some aspects and now you don’t have to
                                know how they function under the hood. Just for example:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>
                                We might have a framework that makes it very easy for us to work with text files.
                                The framework for us will establish the connection with the file, have multiple ways
                                of writing in the data (left to write, up to down, write on other language, etc),
                                analyse data for us in a manner that we want (for example count number of certain
                                letters in a text, or translate the text to other language) and many other things.
                                We won’t need to create tons of code to work with files, as the framework has done
                                it all for us. Now when using this framework we don’t have to worry how to work with
                                a text file, but instead we will need to worry how to use the framework that
                                interacts with files.

                                So, what is the Spring Framework? It is a framework that lets us create web
                                applications very easily. With its help, we can create a software that will be used to
                                interact with data send online. It will take care of things like how to analyse the
                                request our application gets from the user and many other things. We as web
                                developers will need to know how to configure Spring and how to make use of its
                                functionality to create useful web applications.
